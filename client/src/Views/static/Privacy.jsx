      </p>
      <h3 className="privacy privacy-heading-3">Other Processing Grounds</h3>
      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        From time to time, although it is very rare, we may also need to process
        your personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is

        to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as
        described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.

      <h3 className="privacy privacy-heading-3">
        WILL DIGITAL BASE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
      </h3>
      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        We may share your personal information with third-parties that help us
        provide Services and do business. These third-parties include:
        Advertisers: We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners
        (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will
        see their advertisements and/or promotional offers. You agree that we
        may provide any of the information we have collected from you in
        non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that
        Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements
        and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in New
        York to show you ads or offers for New York businesses, but we will not
        tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to
        display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we
        will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate
        form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that
        if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience
        segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you
        fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
      </p>

      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web
        beacon”) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide
        anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for
        advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted
        advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web
        browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad
        network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own
        cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You
        may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third-parties
        through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your
        browser. Please note that we don’t control whether or how these third
        parties comply with Do Not Track requests.
      </p>

      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third-party
        websites we are affiliated with may sell or provide products or services
        to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or
        jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is
        associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your
        personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent
        that it is related to such transaction or Service. We have no control
        over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as
        to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any
        transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business,
        please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
      </p>

      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        Service Providers: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks
        on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
        products or Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our service
        providers do not have any right to use the personal information we share
        with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
      </p>
      <p className="privacy privacy-paragraph">
        Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share
        and/or transfer customer personal information in connection with the
        evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our
        assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or
        go through some other change of control, personal information could be
        one of the assets transferred or acquired as part of this process.

        necessary to comply with any law or court order; enforce or apply our
        Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
        safety of Digital Base, our employees, our users, or others.

        safeguards to protect your personal information, taking into account the

        posed. We are always working to improve these safeguards to help keep
        your personal information secure. Unfortunately, despite our best
        efforts, no security measures are perfect and we cannot guaranty
        complete security.
